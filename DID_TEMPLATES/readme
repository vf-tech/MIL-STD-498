This is a collection of MIL-STD-498 Data Item Descriptor (DID) templates
entered into Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 (and Word for Windows 95)
by Richard Conn for use at Monmouth University in the Software Engineering
Department.  While a lot of effort was expended in trying to ensure that
all DIDs have been accurately entered, no guarantee of the accuracy is
offered and users should review these DIDs before delivering them to their
customers.
